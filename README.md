# posture-check
Posture Check is an in-browser tool that help susers maintain healthy posture by constantly analyzing their sitting posture using camera input and user feedback. This tool is designed to be used by a stationary camera facing you directly. This is meant for more practical usage, typically a webcam facing you directly. It aims to promote physical well-being, something that can be forgotten after long hours at the desk.
